library( conjoint)

### R library for conjoint analysis
conjoint1<- read.csv(“copy and paste the location of your file; mine has got 5 columns”, header=TRUE, sep= ”,”)

###I am here calling a csv but if you have an excel file, you can read an xlxs file as long as you add one extra step which is write library(excel)
survey <- c("NA", "extremely disagree", "disagree", "agree", "extremely agree")   
#### this is based on a likert scake but if you have Y/N or multiple attributes or levels, it is going to be the same. you just have to write them.

#### we now transform the data into a dataframe
 survey.df<- data.frame(survey)
 caModel(conjoint1[,1], conjoint1[2:5])
 Conjoint(conjoint1[,1], conjoint[2:5], survey.df)
 
 ####charts will help you understand the combinations and the utilities.
 
 caTotalUtilities(contjoint1[,1], conjoint1[2:5])  

####my file has 5 columns so you will have to change the numbers in the [] in function of your own dataset. the TotalUtilities can also help ou understand preference by user and characteristics
 
 caSegmentation(conjoint1[,1], conjoint1[2:5], c*3)
 ###clustering data in three groups this will work well even if you are working with ratings on social media.
